## getistio check-upgrade

Check if there are patches available in the current minor version

#### Synopsis

Check if there are patches available in the current minor version, e.g. 1.7-tetrate: 1.7.4-tetrate-v1 -> 1.7.5-tetrate-v1

```
getistio check-upgrade [flags]
```

#### Examples

```
# example output
$ getistio check-upgrade
...
- Your data plane running in multiple minor versions: 1.7-tetrate, 1.8-tetrate
- Your control plane running in multiple minor versions: 1.6-tetrate, 1.8-tetrate
- The minor version 1.6-tetrate is not supported by Tetrate.io. We recommend you use the trusted minor versions in "getistio list"
- There is the available patch for the minor version 1.7-tetrate. We recommend upgrading all 1.7-tetrate versions -> 1.7.4-tetrate-v1
- There is the available patch for the minor version 1.8-tetrate which includes **security upgrades**. We strongly recommend upgrading all 1.8-tetrate versions -> 1.8.1-tetrate-v1

In the above example, we call names in the form of x.y-${flavor} "minor version", where x.y is Istio's official minor and ${flavor} is the flavor of the distribution.
Please refer to 'getistio fetch --help' or 'getistio list --help' for more information.
